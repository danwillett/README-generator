# README Generator 

  
  ## Description 
 
  This project was built to streamline README file generation processes for github repositories. All good repositories should contain a high quality README.md file that effectively explains the rational behind the project and directions for use. Since coders are busy and would probably rather spend their time working on their code rather than README's, this project aims to reduce the amount of time we spend generating a README.

## Usage 

To use this application, first move into the README-generator repository on your local machine and run "npm install" in terminal. This will install the inquirer package that will give you question prompts. Once the inquirer package is installed, run "node index" in the termainl to intiate the README-generator application. 

You will be prompted to fill in the title of your project, description, installation, usage, license, contributors, tests, and FAQs. With the exception of the license prompt which has a checkbox format, to answer the prompts, just type in your response and press answer. For the checkbox format, use the up and down arrow keys to navigate to the different license types. When you've found your license, press the space bar to select your license, and press "enter". When you have finished generating your README, a new file called README.md will be generated in the README-Generator directory.
